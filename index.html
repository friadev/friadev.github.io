                <h2>TF2: Great Game, Poor Design</h2>
                    <p>Team Fortress 2 is a beloved game, but something about it leaves a bad taste in my mouth every time I play it. I've come to the conclusion that, while the base game is excellent, it's full of small annoying design quirks that add up to a bad experience; a true death by a thousand cuts situation. I think these design issues could be used to not just make better games, but better software as a whole.</p>
                    <p>First, the menu. When you boot the game up, you're immediately assaulted with notifications, buttons everywhere, broken features, etc. The TF2 main menu really reminds me of every free to play game full of microtransactions: just crap all over the screen that overloads your brain. No matter what, I always seem to have a notification when I boot the game up, and it's always something I don't care about. This teaches me that notifications are worthless and I should ignore them. The act of having a notification also causes the button to blink, which would normally be ok, but they decided instead of just making the button invisible it should become fully inactive every time it blinks, which means if you try to click it half the time you won't be able to. This is absolutely infuriating design and I'm not sure what the thought process was, if they couldn't make the button blink without fully deleting it then why not just make the notification icon blink?</p>
                    <p>Of course the Mann Co. store is featured prominently. Attempting to view items will oftentimes lead you to accidentally add them to your cart or worse, end up at the checkout screen. When you try to checkout your cart, it opens up a browser window not in your default browser in your OS, but valve's crappy steam browser. No one in their right mind wants to deal with Valve's awful chromium fork, please just get rid of it. So now we've been fully removed from the game, we're on an external site. This is a very awkward and frustrating experience and quite baffling considering at this point I'm trying to give valve my money.</p>
                    <p>We can't really talk about bad design without mentioning that microtransactions are fundamentally bad design. I want to play games to escape, but I'm assaulted with constant attempts to make me buy stuff. The game famously relies on loot boxes for many items, meaning you can't access most of the content of the game without paying a lot of money gambling or buying what you want from the community market. Content that would be a $0.99 DLC in other games is artificially made rare so you have to pay way more money than it's actually worth. There's also the obnoxious and confusing crafting system. Now, it would be nice if you could just ignore all of this and play the game, but unfortunately that's not the case. When you install the game, you get a limited inventory to store items. You will be unlocking new weapons through achievements and random drops, so the space will fill up rather quickly. Once it fills up, the next time you get an item drop it will obnoxiously force you to delete an item before you can keep playing. This shit drives me up the wall honestly. They really force you to interact with their terrible inventory system even if you don't want to. Valve, this doesn't make me want to give you money, it makes me want to uninstall the game.</p>
                    <p>Of course your free to play struggles won't end there. A fundamental part of TF2 is communication, and Valve has provided a handy chat functionality to facilitate it. Unfortunately, unless you pay Valve money, you are barred from using it on official Valve servers. That's right, the chat is a paid feature.</p>
                    <p>An important part of any game or software in general is for it to be intuitive and make sense, not just so new users can pick it up easily but also so advanced users don't have to juggle a hundred things in their head in order to use it efficiently. TF2 has an insane amount of obscure mechanics that you just have to know about, and if you don't, you'll be very confused. Take for instance damage falloff. In other games, when you shoot someone, you deal a predictable amount of damage every time. It's intuitive. If you need to make guns less effective at range, you add a random bloom to shooting so you're less likely to hit your target. Not so in TF2. In this game, there is damage falloff for most (not all) weapons. How do you know which ones? You just have to memorize it. Shooting someone with a bullet from the heavy's minigun could do wildly different amounts of damage depending on how far away you are from the enemy. This is incredibly confusing for new players and it's frankly something you can't calculate in your head if you're an advanced player: you just have a general sense that you'll do more damage up close. Why does TF2 need this mechanic when other games don't? Because for some reason, TF2 has mechanics designed to make it really hard to miss at range. Shotguns always fire one perfectly accurate pellet (the heavy's minigun is actually just an auto shotgun, despite what the fake bullet tracers and sound effects would have you believe). Why do this? I have no idea. The heavy's minigun spread is so insanely wide that if it weren't for this mechanic, he wouldn't be able to hit the broad side of a barn at range. Essentially damage falloff is a solution to an artificial problem they created. Rocket launchers and grenade launchers have slight auto aim, so you'll end up missing sometimes just because the stupid auto aim tries to correct for the trajectory of an enemy that's changing direction. It's needed though since for some reason characters in Valve games don't know how to use their sights, so for hitscan weapons, the bullets come out of their eyes (again the tracers are a lie) and for projectiles, they try to match the position of the view model so they need to do some trigonometry to make the rocket actually hit where your crosshair is aiming. If this sounds like an extremely overcooked solution when you could literally just have sights in your game, that's because it is. So yes, again because they can't just have the soldier's rockets have a bit of random bloom, they need to have damage falloff to compensate.</p>
                    <p>Another obscure mechanic is that heavy actually does less damage when he first starts firing and only after a bit of continuous fire does he do his full damage. He also does less damage to sentries. How are you supposed to know all this? You can't unless you read the wiki. Spies have reduced times for status effects when cloaked as well, something you just have to know somehow.</p>
                    <p>In my opinion, Team Fortress 2 has way too many of these hidden mechanics. I think a good game should make all game elements and mechanics clear to the player so they can plan their strategy around it.</p>
                    <p>This isn't just me randomly railing on TF2, I want to apply this idea to other software as well. Where do you see strange hidden behavior that you just have to magically know about as a user? When is the behavior of a program unclear? Good software should always make everything relevant to the user clear and easy to understand, without strange hidden magic behavior.</p>

                <h2>What Your Phone Has Replaced</h2>
                    <p>Modern smartphones might be some of the most useful devices ever invented. I can't think of anything else that has completely invalidated so many other things just by existing. I remember when I was a kid, we had lots of dedicated devices for different tasks. You had a camera for taking pictures, a GPS for getting around, a CD player or MP3 player for listening to music. But my phone has completely replaced all of those.</p>
                    <h3>Camera</h3>
                        <p>Back in the day, if you wanted to take pictures or video, you needed a camera. We even had those disposable cameras where you needed to take it to a store to get it developed (crazy that we used to just trust random strangers with all our personal photos). Nowadays your phone's camera lets you take photos and videos without having to lug around a whole dedicated camera or camcorder. Of course, professionals will still want to use a dedicated camera, but for the average person, there's really no reason to bother with one anymore.</p>
                    <h3>GPS</h3>
                        <p>When we got our first TomTom GPS (don't hear much about them anymore), I remember how much easier it made family trips. No more fumbling with a map, trying to figure out where you are, or printing off directions from the internet to try and follow. Now there's no need for a dedicated GPS anymore. The same way the GPS invalidated maps, smartphones invalidated GPS's.</p>
                    <h3>Landline</h3>
                        <p>It used to be almost impossible to imagine not having a landline in your house. Even though cell phones existed, a landline was much more reliable. Nowadays with our much improved cellular networks, most people have a reliable phone in their pocket at all times. The concept of having a household phone that you all share seems to have given way to everyone having their own individual phone number. I don't miss it, the loud ringing that would blare out was very annoying and I didn't like having potentially private calls ringing out for everyone in the house to hear.</p>
                    <h3>Step Counter</h3>
                        <p>Our gym coach always had us attach step counters to our waist when we went for runs in school. These were common enough to see back then, people wanted to track how many steps they got in each day. But they were pretty ugly and it was annoying having a little plastic thing clipped to your shirt or pants. Conveniently, smartphones have built-in acceleromters and gyroscopes and they tend to sit around your waist in your pocket, so they can count your steps for you. Even more, they can record your step counts over time to show you have much activity you're getting, and they can alert you to problems like instability in your walk cycle. There is absolutely no reason to buy a dedicated step counter anymore.</p>
                    <h3>Timer</h3>
                        <p>It used to be common to have a physical timer to time how long you're cooking things for. You might also have had a stopwatch for timing your runs maybe. Now it seems quaint to have a comletely dedicated timer for just about anything.</p>
                    <h2>Things Your Phone Will Replace</h2>
                        <p>There's a few things that I think phones have the potential to dethrone but they're just not quite there yet.</p>
                        <h3>Thermometer</h3>
                            <p>The Google Pixel 8 Pro introduced a thermometer to the phone to measure the temperature of objects. It's a neat idea, and if it became widely available then there would again be no need for such a device in your home. You could also imagine an ambient temperature sensor that would let you know what the temperature of your environment is.</p>
                        <h3>Game Console</h3>
                            <p>If you want to game without any hassle, dedicated game consoles have always been the go-to. They provide the power needed to play the latest games at a good price. Portable consoles like the Nintendo Switch and the Steam Deck have been massively popular for their portability as well. But being able to play AAA games on your phone would be even more portable, since you're going to have your phone with you all the time anyway. Now we're starting to see AAA games like the <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/resident-evil-4/id6462360082&ved=2ahUKEwilsY3D9eeMAxXoHNAFHZduF-QQFnoECAkQAQ&usg=AOvVaw1WHYGVMNpjtqO95Gjc3S6C">Resident Evil 4 remake</a> showing up on Apple's app store. There's also been increased support for controllers on mobile. It's only a matter of time before these dedicated portable consoles are a thing of the past.</p>
                        <h3>Home PC</h3>
                            <p>Imagine being able to come home, plug your phone into your monitor to charge, and use your phone as your PC. It's not as far-fetched as it might sound, with Android's <a href="https://chromeunboxed.com/desktop-view-googles-new-desktop-experience-feature-coming-to-android-phones/">upcoming desktop mode</a>. Most things you used to need a PC for are now possible on a phone, with the major exception of programming. However I think most people don't really want to deal with owning a whole PC when their phone will do everything they need.</p>
                        <h3>Measuring Tape</h3>
                            <p>There's already apps that use your phone's camera to judge the distance between two points in space, but I'm putting this here because it's not quite accurate enough yet. With some more refinement I don't think we'll need to carry around measuring tape anymore.</p>
                        <h3>Home Internet</h3>
                            <p>With 5G, it's now possible to get speeds in excess of 1 Gb/s, more than enough for most people's needs. I personaly use T-Mobile home internet already, and it's been great. But I would really love to be able to use my phone as my router in my home, and just rely on my 5G phone plan instead of having to pay for my phone plan *and* a dedicated home internet service. The only thing stopping me right now is the restrictions carriers put on mobile hotspot data. Most of them give you some amount of high-speed data with your plan but restrict you to 2G speeds when you run out. I know there have been <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/5g-rollout-disappointments">issues with 5G's rollout</a>, but as it matures and 6G looms ever closer I expect these hotspot restrictions to ease up.</p>

                <h2>Why Google Chrome <em>Actually</em> Sucks for Privacy</h2>
                    <p>I spend a lot of time in the privacy community and one thing it is absolutely allergic to is nuance. Case in point: Chrome is "spyware."
                    </p>
                    <p>This does nothing but cheapen the term spyware which should be reserved for heinous abuses of privacy like state actors exploiting the devices of journalists to gain info on them
                    or an abusive partner installing stalkerware to track everything their victim is doing.
                    </p>
                    <p>The <em>real</em> problems with Chrome are more specific. Now, credit where it's due, the Chrome security team are some of the best in the industry and they've created the most secure browser engine available; they should be recognized for their incredible work pushing browser security forward for everyone. If you want the most secure browser possible, you need one based on Chromium.
                </p>
                <p>That said, its two main competitors, Safari and Firefox, while having significantly lower install bases, completely wipe the floor with Chrome in terms of their privacy features. Chrome has no option for E2EE sync for anything, so Google has full access to your browsing history, bookmarks, etc should you choose to enable syncing. Chrome doesn't have any anti-fingerprinting features at all. In fact, not only does it lack any kind of fingerprint randomization, it also actively makes fingerprinting worse by implementing <a href="https://webkit.org/standards-positions/">lots of APIs</a> that their competition doesn't for this exact reason. Why does a website need to know how much battery or RAM you have, or the orientation of your phone? It doesn't.
                </p>
                <p>WebKit has a page about the <a href="https://webkit.org/tracking-prevention/">anti-tracking technologies</a> they implement. Firefox forms the basis of the Tor browser and they've been upstreaming Tor browser features for a long time. These teams are the ones improving privacy on the web, not Chromium. Also worth noting the work Brave has done in implementing most of these same features in Chromium, proving it can be done and that Google simply doesn't want to.
